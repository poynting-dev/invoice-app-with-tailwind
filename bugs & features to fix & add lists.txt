When we want to update the image again, then->
    -> first, that previous image is not showing in the user profile page.

When we don't want to update the image, but the other data then ->
    -> how to handle code such that it update the data, but not the image.
            -> if image is already there in db, but we are not updating the image, 
                then write the logic to check that we are not updating the image but updating the other data in profile.
